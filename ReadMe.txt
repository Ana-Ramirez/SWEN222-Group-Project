We have added the commit ID's for each library that is relating to the 
latest version of our libraries with the tests.

For View:
My tests do not currently work due to the nature of the Start() method in JavaFX
applications and the difficulties of creating blank scenes. I will remedy this
in future; however I was mainly planning on mainly implementation testing my
library. My library is not complete yet, and I need to add images to the
ImgResources class and figure out a way to utilise it in the same way that
WheatRun did.

For Logic:
Have written tests for Door.class. Written tests some for Room.class with others
being added but not yet implemented. All the test files will be filled out in 
the near future.

For AI:
Written movement for the AI in all the different strategies. Library is not 
complete yet because I still need to figure some things out with other team 
members and their libraries that relate to mineNot made any tests
yet unfortunately, I will do this tomorrow.
