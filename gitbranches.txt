Using branches in git:
	Using branches in git is useful as it means you can develop your own libaries, commit and push without potentially breaking the master code.
	When ready a given branch can me merged with the master then adopted by everyone else.

	(The main branch is called master)

	To create a new branch:
		git checkout -b <new-branch-name>

	To switch to an existing branch:
		git checkout <existing-branch>

	To merge the master branch with your working branch:
	(Useful to get everyones elses updates without breaking their stuff)

		git checkout master
		git pull
		git checkout <your-branch>
		git merge master

	To merge your working branch into the master:
	(To allow everyone else to use your changes)

		git checkout master
		git merge <your-branch>
		git push
