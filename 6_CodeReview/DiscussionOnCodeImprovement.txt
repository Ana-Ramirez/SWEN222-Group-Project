/**VIEW**/
Tim and I decided to review each others' code instead of what we had been
assigned before starting the assignment as our libraries interact with each
other the most.

Tim told me to change my constructor for the Renderer so that it doesn't take 
any arguments. This mean only one instance of the Renderer can be used for 
multiple different levels and rooms, which is much more efficient. Tim and I 
also decided to remove the main class we previously had in the game, in favour 
of either placing the main method inside MainMenu or inside the actual Game 
class. For now I have a main method in my MainMenu class as this makes it easy 
for me to see my menu progressing. Tim suggested passing my PrimaryStage to his 
controller code for the EventListeners so that he can start and load games.

/**SAVE/LOAD**/
More null checks and error handling required.
Since we started using the Javafx application API Patrick suggested I add a Stage
object parameters to the load and start button handlers.
He also suggested adding type parameters where there were none before and I had
forgotten to close an object stream in save.java. I need to do more commenting
in the Game class.
