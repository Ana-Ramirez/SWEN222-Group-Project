We decided to have Nick and Ana, and Patrick and Tim review each others' code as
these were two pairs of libraries that interacted with each other frequently.
Tim and I decided to review Lewis' code as otherwise he would have no one to
review his. We still have unfinished code for some of our libraries at this
stage, but we've set an internal goal of having everything ready to be added
together by October 4 (the same day as the deadline for external testing).
