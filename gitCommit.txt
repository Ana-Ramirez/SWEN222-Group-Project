To commit your work:

1. git add src //this "stages" the files you are working on so you can add a whole bunch of files here.
    src is just an example becuase it's easiest to do from the directory you are likely to be in
    
2. git commit -m "commit message here"

3. git push

done. double check on gitlab just in case
